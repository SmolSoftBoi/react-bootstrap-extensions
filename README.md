# Getting Started with React Bootstrap Extensions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **18+** (LTS)
- Install dependencies with `yarn install` before running scripts.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the storybook mode.\
Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Runs lint checks.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified.\
React Bootstrap Extensions is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
